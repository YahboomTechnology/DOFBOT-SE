# DOFBOT SE AI Vision Robotic Arm with ROS2 Python Programming (Virtual Machine Version)
![](https://github.com/YahboomTechnology/DOFBOT-SE/blob/main/DOFBOT-SE_RoboticArm_Yahboom.jpg)
# Introduction
DOFBOT-SE is a 6DOF robotic arm developed by Yahboom based on a virtual machine system. It does not require a embedded development board (Jetson NANO/Raspberry Pi), generates control decisions through a PC-side virtual machine, and is driven by an STM32 controller to implement various functions. We use the ROS robot control system to simplify the complex motion control of the 6DOF serial bus servo, enabling the forward and reverse solutions, motion planning, MoveIt simulation, collision detection and other functions to be realized. It comes with a 3MP camera, combined with machine vision algorithms, which not only enables color recognition tracking and grabbing, but also has many functions such as model training, garbage sorting, and gesture recognition. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, DOFBOT-SE is a cost-effective robotics learning kit for you.
# Features
* Virtual machine system development
Based on the design of the virtual machine system, control decisions are generated through the PC-side virtual machine, without the need for embedded development boards, simplifying the learning and use process. (Mac not supported)
* ROS robot control system
The integrated ROS system simplifies the complex motion control of the 6 DOF serial bus servo, and supports functions such as forward solution, inverse solution, and motion planning.
* AI vision functions
Provides MoveIt simulation, collision detection, color recognition tracking, item grabbing, gesture recognition and many other functions.
* Various remote control methods
Yahboom provides multi-functional mobile APP, wireless handle, and PC software, which can be used to control the robotic arm.
* Professional hardware configuration
Include a 30MP camera module, a multi-function expansion board, 5*15KG bus servos + 1*6KG bus servos, and the entire robotic arm is made of white anodized aluminum, which is beautiful and durable.
